This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.\\nCERTAIN TERMS\\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes\\nboth customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. “Net income attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP)\" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) stock-based compensation expense,\\nnet of tax and (b) digital assets loss (gain), net of tax. \"Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and\\nimpairment, (d) stock-based compensation expense and (e) digital assets loss (gain), net. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding\\noperating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts\\npayable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant period\\'s deliveries and using trading days. Constant\\ncurrency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period.\\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to\\ncommon stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA,\\nAdjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management\\nbelieves that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that\\npresentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial\\nmetrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with\\nfinancial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.\\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\\nCertain statements in this update, including, but not limited to, statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the development, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment,\\ndeliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and services; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding\\nexpansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories and refinery are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions\\nand management’s current expectations, involve certain risks and uncertainties, and are not guarantees. Future results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. The following important factors, without limitation,\\ncould cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the risk of delays in launching and/or manufacturing our products, services and features cost-effectively; our ability to build and/or grow our products and\\nservices, sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; our ability to successfully and timely develop, introduce and scale, as well as our consumers’ demand for, products and services based on\\nartificial intelligence, robotics and automation, electric vehicles, Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features, and ride-hailing services generally and our vehicles and services specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules,\\nprices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our\\nability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international operations and expansion, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax, tariff, export controls and labor\\nconditions; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive, transportation and energy product and services markets; our ability to maintain public\\ncredibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to\\nattract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products,\\nwhich may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 30, 2025 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\\nTesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\\n29'}]"
